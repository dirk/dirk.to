        <p class="jw-colophon">
          On the twenty-first of May, 2015, I began a
          road trip with my friend <a href="http://ryngonzalez.com/">Ryan Gonzalez</a>
          across the United States of America from Charleston, South Carolina
          to San Francisco, California. This is the semi-live diary of that voyage.

          <h4 class="jw-day-subheading">Hello goodbye</h4>
          <p class="jw-summary">A mildly tearful goodbye to the parents; a happy welcome from Ryan.</p>
          <p class="jw-photo"><img src="images/21-home.jpg" /></p>
          <p>A last sight of home. So long, Charleston; it's been fun.</p>

            We set off some time around 7 or 8 in the morning from Ryan's parents'
            in Greenwood, South Carolina, or as I would refer to it with
            characteristic Charlestonian fashion, "Yet Another City In South
            Carolina That I've Never Heard Of". There's a reason why the rest
            of the state doesn't like people from Charleston.

            Picturesque little South Carolina town we passed through on the

            Beautiful "god rays" over some river somewhere in Mississippi. Or
            at least I think it was Mississippi. It, Alabama, and Louisiana
            all sort of blended in together.

          <h4 class="jw-day-subheading">Into Texas</h4>
          <p class="jw-summary">
            Today we got a first taste of the best thing about Texas and the
            worst thing about Texas. The best thing is that Texas has figured
            out that it's perfectly fine to have 80 miles-per-hour speed
            limits. If only the rest of this country would realize that.
            Despite the lovely speed limit, we also discovered first-hand
            that Texas is big, really big.<br /><br />
            In Austin Ryan and I split ways to meet up with respective
            old friends. I got a good taste of the special (ie. annoying)
            character of Austin: endless traffic and long lines everywhere.

          <p class="jw-photo"><img src="images/23-gas.jpg" /></p>
          <p>
            Stopped for gas a bit of the way into Texas; turned off of the
            interstate on the way to Austin.

            Visited a meadery in Austin. Discovered I like mead.

          <h4 class="jw-day-subheading">Texas from dawn to dusk</h4>
          <p class="jw-summary">
            We spent the entire day in Texas today on the long road from
            Austin to El Paso. It was very long, very boring, very full of
            desert.
          </p>
          <p class="jw-photo"><img src="images/24-junction-1.jpg" /></p>
          <p>
            The morning was still damp from the night's rain. We stopped for
            gas and a snack at a crossing named Junction, Texas.
          </p>
          <p class="jw-photo"><img src="images/24-junction-2.jpg" /></p>
          <p>
            Quite a bug collection had been amassed, and yet more were to
            be collected.

          <p class="jw-photo"><img src="images/24-desert-1.jpg" /></p>

          <p class="jw-photo"><img src="images/24-desert-3.jpg" /></p>
          <p>We drove through a great deal of desert on the way to El Paso.</p>
          <p class="jw-photo"><img src="images/24-el-paso-1.jpg" /></p>
          <p class="jw-photo"><img src="images/24-el-paso-2.jpg" /></p>
          <p class="jw-photo"><img src="images/24-el-paso-3.jpg" /></p>
          <p>
            After meeting up with my cousin and their spouse, we all headed up
            to a nearby mountain (literally a mile away) to get a beautiful
            view of the El Paso and Ju√°rez.
          </p>
          <p class="jw-photo"><img src="images/24-el-paso-4.jpg" /></p>
          <p class="jw-photo"><img src="images/24-el-paso-5.jpg" /></p>
          <p>
            A weirdly-quick drive down through the city brought us to the
            USA-Mexico border fence: the great metal testament to the
            stupidity of the human race.

          <p class="jw-photo"><img src="images/24-el-paso-7.jpg" /></p>
          <p>We found life in a really goddamn depressing place.</p>
          <p class="jw-photo"><img src="images/24-el-paso-8.jpg" /></p>
          <p>A farcical boondoggle and affront to common decency &amp; kindness.</p>
