        <p class="jw-colophon">
          On the twenty-first of May, 2015, I began a
          road trip with my friend <a href="http://ryngonzalez.com/">Ryan Gonzalez</a>
          across the United States of America from Charleston, South Carolina
          to San Francisco, California. This is the semi-live diary of that voyage.

            We set off some time around 7 or 8 in the morning from Ryan's parents'
            in Greenwood, South Carolina, or as I would refer to it with
            characteristic Charlestonian fashion, "Yet Another City In South
            Carolina That I've Never Heard Of". There's a reason why the rest
            of the state doesn't like people from Charleston.

          <h4 class="jw-day-subheading">Into Texas</h4>
          <p class="jw-summary">
            Today we got a first taste of the best thing about Texas and the
            worst thing about Texas. The best thing is that Texas has figured
            out that it's perfectly fine to have 80 miles-per-hour speed
            limits. If only the rest of this country would realize that.
            Despite the lovely speed limit, we also discovered first-hand
            that Texas is big, really big.<br /><br />
            In Austin Ryan and I split ways to meet up with respective
            old friends. I got a good taste of the special (ie. annoying)
            character of Austin: endless traffic and long lines everywhere.

          <p class="jw-summary">
            We spent the entire day in Texas today on the long road from
            Austin to El Paso. It was very long, very boring, very full of
            desert.
          </p>
          <p class="jw-photo"><img src="images/24-junction-1.jpg" /></p>
          <p>
            The morning was still damp from the night's rain. We stopped for
            gas and a snack at a crossing named Junction, Texas.

          <p class="jw-photo"><img src="images/24-junction-2.jpg" /></p>

            Quite a bug collection had been amassed, and yet more were to
            be collected.

          <p>
            After meeting up with my cousin and their spouse, we all headed up
            to a nearby mountain (literally a mile away) to get a beautiful
            view of El Paso and Ju√°rez.

            A weirdly-quick drive down through the city brought us to the
            USA-Mexico border fence: the great metal testament to the
            stupidity of the human race.

          <p>We found life in a really goddamn depressing place.</p>
          <p class="jw-photo"><img src="images/24-el-paso-8.jpg" /></p>
          <p>A farcical boondoggle and affront to common decency &amp; kindness.</p>

            Leaving El Paso we took a detour to visit White Sands National
            Monument, the largest gypsum salt dunes in the world. (It even
            smelled like the beach!) We then headed across New
            Mexico&mdash;winding along back-road highways&mdash;and into
            Arizona towards Phoenix.

          <p>
            Down in the valleys between the dunes there is an eerie silence.
            The salt sand seems to absorb and block all sound from the other
            side, leaving just the slight rustle of wind and one's own
            movement &amp; breathing.

            From White Sands we headed across New Mexico towards Arizona.
            Straddling the border was a remote .
            We wound through the twisty, exhilarating mountain roads;
            after what felt like half an hour of roaring through the passes
            we arrived&mdash;hearts pounding&mdash;at

            Cliffs loomed around us; and ahead the view opened up to
            reveal a landscape of smaller mountains, rolling hills,

            From Phoenix we drove to Los Angeles; the landscape gradually

          <p class="jw-summary">
            We set off from Los Angeles up the Pacific Coast Highway.
            The slightly confusing route and my navigation goofs combined
            to put us a bit behind schedule, but exuberant driving along
            the windy cliffside roads made that time back handily.

            The fields of grass and scrub along the cliffside were lit in a
            neat blue haze from the sun and the sea.

            We arrived at Carmel-by-the-Sea in the early evening. Thankfully
            there was enough light left to walk down the hill to the beach.
            The sand there was surprisingly white, and the overcast skies
            gave a cool leaden light to the shore.
